# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Python-Data-Analysis-Project
Built a Movie Recommendation System in Python using content-based filtering. Used pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data cleaning, EDA, and cosine similarity with TF-IDF. Worked with real-world data (TMDB/IMDb). Runs via command line, no UI included.
